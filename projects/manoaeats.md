ManoaEats provides dining information on the UHM campus. The ManoaEats web application allows students or campus officials to find information about the various vendors and locations offered on campus. They can share their own reviews or ratings of suppliers with other users. In addition, each vendor list provides a link to the restaurant's campus website, so they can easily navigate to the exact location, menu, and operating hours with one click. In addition to that, vendor administrator are free to register and promote their restaurants and freely edit the information.
