ManoaEats provides dining information on the UHM campus. The ManoaEats web application allows students or campus officials to find information about the various vendors and locations offered on campus. They can share their own reviews or ratings of suppliers with other users. In addition, each vendor list provides a link to the restaurant's campus website, so they can easily navigate to the exact location, menu, and operating hours with one click. In addition to that, vendor administrator are free to register and promote their restaurants and freely edit the information.

## Project Contribution

<br />
To complete our team project, I built up a page and vendor data to provide users with a list of vendors, the ultimate goal of the project. Also, our web application required at least 3 roles. A total of three roles were needed: the user who will use ManoaEats, the vendor to provide information on the restaurant, and the admin who can manage everything. Therefore, I have built a publication to detail the three roles so that they can control their accessibility and page permissions. In the process of working on the page, I got a desire to provide my own special skills as it was completed to some extent, so I wanted to provide ratings and reviews to users using UI Semantic, so I tried it, and as a result, it was very successful.

## Review 

<br />

When I first started the ICS314 Final Team project, I was tremendously confused. First of all, while I could go back and fix a problem if I fail in a personal project, that wasn’t an option for a group project. 

<br />

Having to carry out numerous projects in a short period of time, whether to learn front-end from the basics or not was an issue. For instance, there were areas which I was not so confident about, such as UI, design, CSS and Javascript as part of the project. However, with a sense of responsibility I put in as much effort as I can. As a result, by staying up all night during the project, I was able to finish my own part. 

<br />

This project taught me a lot. Firstly I realized how attractive front-end programming is. Unlike programming languages that I have learned before including Java, C, and C++, Javascript was interesting in the way that the process could be immediately visualized on the local website and not the console window. Additionally, this process taught me that I do not have to be afraid before trying. Unlike my expectations of working in a group project, our project turned out great. Synergy that comes from a team cannot be replaceable, just like how fun and excitement from collaboration can’t either.

## To my team members (Christine, Jerome, Marjorie)

<br />
My first language was not English, so I had the biggest concern about communication with team members in the linguistic part. However, Marjorie, Jerome, and Christine, who were members of the same group as me, helped me a lot with a lot of patience, so I think I was able to finish this far. I would like to thank them again. Being able to be with them comforted me, who was lonely with the COVID-19 pendemic.
