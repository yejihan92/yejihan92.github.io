ManoaEats provides dining information on the UHM campus. The ManoaEats web application allows students or campus officials to find information about the various vendors and locations offered on campus. They can share their own reviews or ratings of suppliers with other users. In addition, each vendor list provides a link to the restaurant's campus website, so they can easily navigate to the exact location, menu, and operating hours with one click. In addition to that, vendor administrator are free to register and promote their restaurants and freely edit the information.

## Project Contribution

<br />
To complete our team project, I built up a page and vendor data to provide users with a list of vendors, the ultimate goal of the project. Also, our web application required at least 3 roles. A total of three roles were needed: the user who will use ManoaEats, the vendor to provide information on the restaurant, and the admin who can manage everything. Therefore, I have built a publication to detail the three roles so that they can control their accessibility and page permissions. In the process of working on the page, I got a desire to provide my own special skills as it was completed to some extent, so I wanted to provide ratings and reviews to users using UI Semantic, so I tried it, and as a result, it was very successful.

## Review 

<br />
When I first started the ICS314 Final Team project, I was in tremendous confusion. There were several reasons. First of all, if I fail or give up on a project that I do on my own, I can revert to something that wasn't there, but working together as a group is no longer an option. In a situation where there are various schedules, such as various plans, assignments of other classes, existing projects, school schedules, etc., I thought to learn from the basics of the front end and have to start from beginning. In particular, I myself thought that I was not confident in design and UI, and I also lacked understanding of CSS or Javascript. However, with a sense of responsibility, I thought that I should do my part even if it did not help the team members. As a result, during the month of working on the project, I stayed up almost all night and put more effort than usual. 
<br />
In the process of working on this project, I realized a lot. Firstly, I felt that the front end is really attractive programming. Unlike the Java, C, and C++ programming languages that I have learned before, Javascript was very interested and amazing that the process I was working on was immediately visible on the local website, not on the console window. The second thing I realized was, "I don't have to be scared from the beginning." As I said above, I have found it to be such a fun and exciting thing to collaborate with someone other than me. No matter how great a developer I am, I learned the synergy that comes from the team rather than the individual.

## To my team members (Christine, Jerome, Marjorie)

<br />
My first language was not English, so I had the biggest concern about communication with team members in the linguistic part. However, Marjorie, Jerome, and Christine, who were members of the same group as me, helped me a lot with a lot of patience, so I think I was able to finish this far. I would like to thank them again. Being able to be with them comforted me, who was lonely with the COVID-19 pendemic.
