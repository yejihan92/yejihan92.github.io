## Technology in Our Lives

<ul>
I wake up listening to the sound of my smartphone alarm. This morning, the clock on my smartphone screen was 10 o'clock on September 4, 2020. Thus, I suddenly decided to find out the relationship between my daily life and technology today. How could we get up in the morning without this daily cell phone alarm function? I was so shocked that how dependent human are to the cell phones as soon as they wake up in the morning. If mobile phones in the past were largely regarded as a means of communication with call and text message functions, smartphones released about 10 years ago began to dominate human daily life itself as soon as they were released, and I think there is based on an application'. Numerous applications on smartphones and smartphones are developing and creating new technologies by fusion with existing technologies in various fields such as finance, Internet web browser, SNS, media, and transportation. As a result, tasks that could be done with different devices can now be solved in a sitting position with only a smartphone, and as many technologies are introduced into the smartphone, humans are in an environment where they cannot live without the domination of smartphones technology.

I am currently conducting non-face-to-face classes at home due to COVID-19, but if it is normal, I am ready to take the bus and leave my home for class. Unlike before, we don't just wait for the bus to come. By using the real-time bus guidance system application installed on our smartphone, we can easily find out when the bus we need to take on our smartphone is coming, where it is now, and when it will arrive at our destination. Whereas in the past, simply a means of transportation such as a bus and GPS technology existed separately, now the convergence of these two technologies has resulted in a new technology which is a real-time bus guidance system.The characteristics of the technology are gradually maximized, and relationships are established based on humans and society.

Arriving at McDonald's for lunch, I used a 'drive-thru'. The ordering method of 'drive-thru' is ordering food and picking it up when the customer arrives at the place the customer is ordering without getting off the vehicle. Fast food has emerged in response to the demand for quick and convenient meals in a modern busy life. This will also be an example in which the development of technology has had a great influence on society. McDonald's employees with headsets and microphones installed in the vehicle's ordering area communicate with customers. When orders are entered into the device, the details are passed on to the employees, and food can be prepared for the customer during checkout. All of this is done with technology, and the development of this technology has made it possible to serve food faster and more accurately without entering the store directly to order.This “drive-thru” technology, which exactly faces the purpose of fast food, is increasingly spreading and can be found not only in fast food restaurants but also in coffee shops today. I realized that the relationship between technology and society is not simply a general-passive relationship in which the development of technology affects society, but a two-way relationship in which a specific atmosphere or demand of society affects the development of new technologies.
